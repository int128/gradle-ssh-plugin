### Development

Gradle SSH Plugin internally uses [Groovy SSH](https://github.com/int128/groovy-ssh) library.
It depends on [JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/).

The document is maintained on the repository of Groovy SSH.

#### Acceptance Test

We can run the acceptance test to verify behavior of the plugin on Gradle.
Test condition can be set by system properties as follows:

System Property             | Value                         | Default
----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------
`target.gradle.versions`    | List of target Gradle version | current version and 1.12
`target.java.home`          | Target JVM                    | current JVM

e.g.

```sh
# Setup SSH server on Docker
./acceptance-test/setup-ssh.sh

# Run test
./gradlew -Ptarget.gradle.versions=3.0,2.0,1.12 :acceptance-test:test
```

### Release

Push a versioned tag to GitHub and CI will upload the artifact to Bintray.
