Gradle SSH Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/int128/gradle-ssh-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/int128/gradle-ssh-plugin)
=================

This plugin provides remote command execution and file transfer capabilities.

See also [test features](acceptance-test/features.gradle) and [release note](https://github.com/int128/gradle-ssh-plugin/releases).


How to use
----------

Add a dependency and apply it in your build.gradle:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'org.hidetake:gradle-ssh-plugin:0.2.1'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'ssh'
```


Define remote hosts
-------------------

At first, define remote hosts:

```groovy
remotes {
  web01 {
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
    password = System.properties['ssh.password']
  }
}
```

A remote host instance has following properties:

  * `host` - Hostname or IP address
  * `port` - Port. Default is 22. (Optional)
  * `user` - User name.
  * `password` - Password for password authentication. (Optional)
  * `identity` - Private key file for public-key authentication. This overrides global identity. (Optional)
  * `passphrase` - Pass phrase for the private key. (Optional)

Also remote hosts can be associated with roles, using `role(name)` like:

```groovy
remotes {
  web01 {
    role('webServers')
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    //...
  }
  web02 {
    role('webServers')
    host = '192.168.1.102'
    //...
  }
  web03 {
    role('webServers')
    host = '192.168.1.103'
    //...
  }
}
```

Calling the function `remotes.role()` with roles will return list of remote hosts associated with those roles.


Define a SSH task
-----------------

To define a SSH task, write `task(type: SshTask)` like:

```groovy
task checkWebServer(type: SshTask) {
  session(remotes.web01) {
    def pids = execute('pidof nginx').trim().split(/ /)
    assert pids.length > 1
  }
}

task reloadServers(type: SshTask) {
  session(remotes.role('webServers', 'dbServers')) {
    executeBackground('sudo service httpd reload', pty: true)
  }
}
```


### Task configuration

In the `SshTask` closure, following methods and properties are available:
  * `session(remote)` - Adds a session to the remote host.
  * `session(remotes)` - Adds each session of remote hosts. If a list is given, sessions will be executed in order. Otherwise, order is not defined.
  * `config(key: value)` - Adds an configuration entry. All configurations are given to JSch. This method overwrites entries if same defined in convention.
  * `dryRun` - Dry run flag. If true, performs no action. Default is according to the convention property.
  * `outputLogLevel` - Log level of standard output for executing commands. Default is according to the convention property.
  * `errorLogLevel` - Log level of standard error for executing commands. Default is according to the convention property.
  * `encoding` - Encoding of input and output for executing commands. Default is according to the convention property.

Specification of the closure is defined in the [class SshSpec](src/main/groovy/org/hidetake/gradle/ssh/api/SshSpec.groovy).
Note that the closure will be called in **evaluation** phase on Gradle.


### Session operation

In the `session` closure, following methods and properties are available:
  * `execute(command)` - Executes a command. This method blocks until the command is completed and returns output of the command.
  * `executeSudo(command)` - Executes a command as sudo (prepends sudo -S -p). Used to support sudo commands requiring password. This method blocks until the command is completed and returns output of the command.
  * `executeBackground(command)` - Executes a command in background. Other operations will be performed concurrently.
  * `shell` - Opens a shell. This method blocks until the shell is finished. Note that you should provide termination input such as `exit` or `quit` with the interaction closure.
  * `get(remote, local)` - Fetches a file or directory from remote host.
  * `put(local, remote)` - Sends a file or directory to remote host.
  * `remote` - Remote host of current session. (Read only)

Specification of the closure is defined in the [interface OperationHandler](src/main/groovy/org/hidetake/gradle/ssh/api/OperationHandler.groovy).
Note that the closure will be called in **execution** phase on Gradle.

Above operations accepts option arguments.
For instance, adding `pty: true` makes the channel to request PTY allocation (to execute sudo).


#### Result handling

Session operation methods will raise an exception if error occurs:
  * `execute` throws an exception if exit status of the remote command is not zero.
  * `executeSudo` throws an exception if exit status of the remote command is not zero, including sudo authentication failure.
  * `executeBackground` throws an exception if exit status of the remote command is not zero, but does not interrupt any other background operations. If any command cause error, the task will be failed.
  * `shell` throws an exception if exit status of the shell is not zero.
  * `get` - throws an exception if error occurs.
  * `put` - throws an exception if error occurs.

These methods return value:
  * `execute` returns a string from standard output of the remote command. Line separators are converted to platform native.
  * `executeSudo` returns a string from standard output of the remote command, excluding sudo interactions. Line separators are same as above.


#### Command interaction support

`execute` and `shell` method can take a closure for interaction.
```groovy
execute('passwd', pty: true) {
  interaction {
    when(partial: ~/.+[Pp]assowrd: */) {
      standardInput << oldPassword << '\n'
      when(partial: ~/.+[Pp]assowrd: */) {
        standardInput << newPassword << '\n'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the `interaction` closure, use `when` methods to declare rules:
  * `when(nextLine: pattern, from: stream) { action }` - When next line from the `stream` matches to the `pattern`, the action will be called.
  * `when(line: pattern, from: stream) { action }` - When a line from the `stream` matches to the `pattern`, the action will be called.
  * `when(partial: pattern, from: stream) { action }` - Performs match when the stream is flushed. This is useful for answering to a prompt such as `yes or no?`.

`pattern` is one of following:
  * If pattern is a string, it performs exact match.
  * If pattern is a regular expression, it performs regular expression match. Groovy provides pretty notation such as `~/pattern/`.
  * If pattern is `_`, it matches to any line even if empty.

`stream` is one of following:
  * `standardOutput` - Standard output of the command.
  * `standardError` - Standard error of the command.
  * If stream is omitted, it means any.

Rules will be evaluated in order. First rule has the highest priority.

In the action closure, following property is available:
  * `standardInput` - Output stream to the remote command. (Read only)

See also sudo password interactions in the [class DefaultOperationHandler](src/main/groovy/org/hidetake/gradle/ssh/internal/DefaultOperationHandler.groovy).


Use SSH in the task
-------------------

To execute SSH in the task, call `sshexec()` method with a closure:

```groovy
task prepareEnvironment {
  doLast {
    def operation = 'reload'
    sshexec {
      session(remotes.role('webServers')) {
        execute("sudo service httpd ${operation}", pty: true)
      }
    }
  }
}
```


Convention properties
---------------------

Global settings can be defined in the `ssh` closure:

```groovy
ssh {
  dryRun = true
  identity = file('config/identity.key')
  config(StrictHostKeyChecking: 'no')
}
```

Following properties and methods are available:

  * `identity` - Private key file for public-key authentication. This can be overridden by remote specific one.
  * `passphrase` - Pass phrase for the private key.
  * `config(key: value)` - Adds configuration entries. All configurations are passed to JSch.
  * `dryRun` - Dry run flag. If true, performs no action. Default is false.
  * `retryCount` - Retrying count to establish connection. Default is 0 (no retry).
  * `retryWaitSec` - Time in seconds between each retries. Default is 0 (immediately).
  * `outputLogLevel` - Log level of standard output while command execution. Default is `LogLevel.QUIET`.
  * `errorLogLevel` - Log level of standard error while command execution. Default is `LogLevel.ERROR`.
  * `encoding` - Encoding of input and output for executing commands. Default is UTF-8.

Specification of the closure is defined in [SshSpec](src/main/groovy/org/hidetake/gradle/ssh/api/SshSpec.groovy).
